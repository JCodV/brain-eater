game inspired by a coolmathgame i played.
this game runs in 2 phases:
- prep phase
- fighting phase

prep phase:
- farm for food and other resources
- more food allows for faster population growth

fighting phase:
- either invade, be pacifist or potentially get invaded
- invasions result in either resource gain/loss population gain/loss or both

how to build the civilization?

composed of building and land:
farmers occupy farming tiles
miners enter caves
guards surround the civilization

there is a small chance that a enemy civilization will come to invade your civilization, if you have guards out, the civ will be notified, commencing battle.
