game inspired by a coolmathgame i played.
this game runs in 2 phases:
- prep phase
- fighting phase

prep phase:
- farm for food and other resources
- more food allows for faster population growth

fighting phase:
- either invade, be pacifist or potentially get invaded
- invasions result in either resource gain/loss population gain/loss or both

see how large you can make it, population count should be win condition
