a monster is chasing you, you have to escape it by traversing doors of a dungeon.
opening doors leads to different possibilities,
- ex mini fights, items, etc

you are aware of the number of doors the monster is behind you.

if you make it to the last door, the monster eventually catches up to you 
and you now fight it
- or maybe its optional idk

core gameplay to implement:
[ ] door selection
[ ] randomness behind doors
[ ] hp, inventory


or maybe this is just a doors rewrite, if so,
we use a queue for tracking events
